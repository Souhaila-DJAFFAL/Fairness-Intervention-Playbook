# Case Study: Loan Approval System Bias Remediation
## Comprehensive Application of the Fairness Intervention Playbook

### Executive Summary

This case study demonstrates the complete application of our Fairness Intervention Playbook to address gender bias in a bank's loan approval system. The intervention reduced approval disparities from 18% to 4.8% while maintaining predictive performance, showcasing how systematic fairness intervention can achieve both ethical and business objectives.

### Problem Statement

**Context**: A mid-sized bank's AI-powered loan approval system showed significant gender disparities:
- Male applicants: 76% approval rate
- Female applicants: 58% approval rate
- 18% disparity despite similar qualification levels

**Business Impact**:
- Regulatory scrutiny and potential legal action
- Reputational damage and customer complaints
- Risk of discriminatory lending violations
- Lost business from qualified female applicants

**Technical Challenge**:
- Multiple bias mechanisms operating simultaneously
- Complex interactions between protected attributes and legitimate predictors
- Need to maintain lending accuracy while ensuring fairness

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Causal Analysis

### 1.1 Comprehensive Data Audit

**Representation Analysis**:
```
Dataset Composition (50,000 loan applications):
- Gender Distribution: 52% Male, 48% Female
- Age Distribution: Balanced across age groups
- Intersectional Gaps: 
  * Young women (18-30): 12% underrepresented
  * Women of color: 15% underrepresented
  * Older women (50+): 8% underrepresented
```

**Initial Fairness Metrics**:
| Metric | Male | Female | Disparity |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|
| Approval Rate | 76% | 58% | 18% |
| Default Rate (actual) | 12% | 11% | 1% |
| False Positive Rate | 8% | 6% | 2% |
| False Negative Rate | 15% | 28% | 13% |

**Key Finding**: Similar actual default rates suggest discrimination rather than legitimate risk differences.

### 1.2 Causal Model Construction

**Variable Classification**:
```python
variables = {
    'protected_attributes': ['gender', 'age', 'marital_status'],
    'outcomes': ['loan_approval', 'default_risk_score'],
    'mediators': ['income', 'employment_history', 'credit_history'],
    'proxies': ['loan_purpose', 'part_time_status', 'industry_sector'],
    'legitimate_predictors': ['debt_to_income_ratio', 'savings', 'payment_history'],
    'confounders': ['education', 'family_background', 'economic_conditions']
}
```

**Causal Pathways Identified**:

1. **Indirect Discrimination** (40% of disparity):
   - Gender → Employment Gaps → Credit History → Approval
   - Gender → Income Level → Debt Ratios → Approval

2. **Proxy Discrimination** (35% of disparity):
   - Gender → Part-time Status → Stability Assessment → Approval
   - Gender → Loan Purpose (home vs. business) → Risk Assessment → Approval

3. **Historical Bias** (25% of disparity):
   - Past discriminatory decisions embedded in training data
   - Biased risk models from previous lending practices

### 1.3 Counterfactual Analysis

**Individual Fairness Testing**:
```python
# Example counterfactual analysis
def test_individual_fairness(applicant):
    original_score = model.predict(applicant)
    
    # Change gender while keeping qualifications constant
    counterfactual = applicant.copy()
    counterfactual['gender'] = 'male' if applicant['gender'] == 'female' else 'female'
    counterfactual_score = model.predict(counterfactual)
    
    return {
        'original_score': original_score,
        'counterfactual_score': counterfactual_score,
        'unfair_advantage': abs(original_score - counterfactual_score) > 0.05
    }

# Results: 34% of female applicants would receive higher scores if male
```

**Path-Specific Effect Decomposition**:
| Pathway | Effect Size | Classification | Intervention Target |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Gender → Employment Gaps → Approval | -0.12 | Problematic | Transform employment features |
| Gender → Income → Approval | -0.08 | Contested | Careful income handling |
| Gender → Part-time Status → Approval | -0.06 | Problematic | Remove proxy effect |
| Gender → Loan Purpose → Approval | -0.04 | Problematic | Purpose transformation |

---

## Phase 2: Intervention Strategy and Implementation

### 2.1 Intervention Selection

Based on causal analysis, we implemented a multi-pronged approach:

| Bias Mechanism | Intervention Type | Specific Technique | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Employment Gaps | Pre-processing | Feature transformation | Convert gaps to "relevant experience" |
| Income Disparities | In-processing | Constrained optimization | Reduce weight on raw income |
| Part-time Proxy | Pre-processing | Disparate impact removal | Remove gender correlation |
| Historical Bias | Pre-processing | Instance reweighting | Correct training data imbalance |

### 2.2 Pre-Processing Interventions

#### Employment History Transformation
```python
def transform_employment_history(data):
    """Convert potentially biased employment gaps into fair experience metric"""
    
    # Original feature: continuous_employment_months (biased against women)
    # New feature: relevant_experience_score
    
    for applicant in data:
        # Calculate relevant experience considering career breaks
        total_experience = applicant['total_work_years']
        skill_currency = calculate_skill_currency(applicant['recent_roles'])
        career_progression = assess_progression(applicant['role_history'])
        
        # Create composite score that doesn't penalize career breaks
        applicant['relevant_experience_score'] = (
            0.4 * total_experience +
            0.4 * skill_currency +
            0.2 * career_progression
        )
        
        # Remove biased original feature
        del applicant['continuous_employment_months']
    
    return data
```

#### Instance Reweighting for Historical Bias
```python
def calculate_fairness_weights(data):
    """Reweight training samples to correct historical bias"""
    
    weights = {}
    
    for gender in ['male', 'female']:
        for outcome in ['approved', 'denied']:
            # Calculate observed vs. fair representation
            observed_rate = len(data[(data.gender == gender) & (data.outcome == outcome)]) / len(data)
            
            # Target: equal approval rates for equal qualifications
            if outcome == 'approved':
                target_rate = calculate_fair_approval_rate(data, gender)
            else:
                target_rate = 1 - target_rate
            
            # Assign higher weights to underrepresented combinations
            weights[(gender, outcome)] = target_rate / observed_rate if observed_rate > 0 else 1.0
    
    return weights
```

#### Disparate Impact Removal for Part-Time Status
```python
def remove_part_time_bias(data, repair_level=0.7):
    """Remove correlation between part-time status and gender"""
    
    # Calculate gender-specific distributions of part-time status
    male_pt_dist = data[data.gender == 'male']['part_time_status'].value_counts(normalize=True)
    female_pt_dist = data[data.gender == 'female']['part_time_status'].value_counts(normalize=True)
    
    # Create fair distribution (weighted average)
    fair_dist = (male_pt_dist + female_pt_dist) / 2
    
    # Transform part-time status to match fair distribution
    for idx, row in data.iterrows():
        original_status = row['part_time_status']
        gender = row['gender']
        
        # Apply repair with specified intensity
        if random.random() < repair_level:
            # Sample from fair distribution instead of gender-specific
            new_status = np.random.choice(fair_dist.index, p=fair_dist.values)
            data.at[idx, 'part_time_status'] = new_status
    
    return data
```

### 2.3 In-Processing Interventions

#### Constrained Optimization for Income Fairness
```python
class FairLoanModel:
    def __init__(self, fairness_constraint_weight=0.3):
        self.model = LogisticRegression()
        self.fairness_weight = fairness_constraint_weight
    
    def fair_loss_function(self, y_true, y_pred, protected_attr):
        """Combine prediction loss with fairness constraint"""
        
        # Standard prediction loss
        prediction_loss = log_loss(y_true, y_pred)
        
        # Fairness constraint: demographic parity
        male_approval_rate = y_pred[protected_attr == 'male'].mean()
        female_approval_rate = y_pred[protected_attr == 'female'].mean()
        fairness_violation = abs(male_approval_rate - female_approval_rate)
        
        # Combined objective
        total_loss = prediction_loss + self.fairness_weight * fairness_violation
        
        return total_loss
    
    def fit(self, X, y, protected_attr):
        """Train model with fairness constraints"""
        
        # Use custom optimization with fairness constraints
        optimizer = ConstrainedOptimizer(
            objective=lambda params: self.fair_loss_function(y, self.predict_proba(X, params), protected_attr),
            constraints=[
                # Demographic parity constraint
                lambda params: abs(self.group_prediction_rate(X, params, 'male') - 
                                 self.group_prediction_rate(X, params, 'female')) <= 0.05
            ]
        )
        
        self.model.coef_ = optimizer.optimize()
        return self
```

#### Adversarial Debiasing for Proxy Variables
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class AdversarialFairModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim=64):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Main predictor network
        self.predictor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
        
        # Adversarial network (tries to predict gender from predictor's hidden layer)
        self.adversary = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Get hidden representation
        hidden = self.predictor[:-2](x)  # All layers except final
        
        # Main prediction
        loan_pred = torch.sigmoid(self.predictor[-1](hidden))
        
        # Adversarial prediction (gender from hidden layer)
        gender_pred = self.adversary(hidden)
        
        return loan_pred, gender_pred
    
    def training_step(self, batch, lambda_adv=1.0):
        x, y_loan, y_gender = batch
        
        loan_pred, gender_pred = self.forward(x)
        
        # Main loss (loan prediction)
        loan_loss = nn.BCELoss()(loan_pred, y_loan)
        
        # Adversarial loss (want to prevent gender prediction)
        adv_loss = nn.BCELoss()(gender_pred, y_gender)
        
        # Combined loss (minimize loan loss, maximize adversarial loss)
        total_loss = loan_loss - lambda_adv * adv_loss
        
        return total_loss
```

### 2.4 Post-Processing Adjustments

#### Threshold Optimization for Equal Opportunity
```python
def optimize_fair_thresholds(model, test_data, fairness_metric='equal_opportunity'):
    """Find optimal decision thresholds for each group"""
    
    # Get prediction scores
    scores = model.predict_proba(test_data[features])[:, 1]
    
    # Optimize thresholds per group
    thresholds = {}
    
    if fairness_metric == 'equal_opportunity':
        # Optimize for equal true positive rates
        for gender in ['male', 'female']:
            gender_mask = test_data['gender'] == gender
            gender_scores = scores[gender_mask]
            gender_labels = test_data[gender_mask]['loan_default']
            
            # Find threshold that maximizes TPR while maintaining overall accuracy
            best_threshold = 0.5
            best_tpr = 0
            
            for threshold in np.arange(0.1, 0.9, 0.01):
                predictions = (gender_scores >= threshold).astype(int)
                tpr = recall_score(gender_labels, predictions)
                
                if tpr > best_tpr:
                    best_tpr = tpr
                    best_threshold = threshold
            
            thresholds[gender] = best_threshold
    
    return thresholds

# Apply optimized thresholds
fair_thresholds = optimize_fair_thresholds(model, validation_data)
# Result: {'male': 0.52, 'female': 0.41}
```
