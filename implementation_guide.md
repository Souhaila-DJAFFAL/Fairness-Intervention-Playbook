# Implementation Guide
## How to Use the Fairness Intervention Playbook

### Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing fairness interventions across your AI systems. It bridges the gap between theoretical fairness concepts and practical engineering implementation.

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

### 1.1 Initial Fairness Assessment

**Objective**: Determine if fairness intervention is needed and identify the scope.

**Steps**:
1. **Stakeholder Identification**
   - Identify affected user groups and protected attributes
   - Document business context and regulatory requirements
   - Engage domain experts and legal counsel

2. **Data Audit**
   - Use the comprehensive data auditing framework from the Pre-Processing Toolkit
   - Analyze representation across intersectional groups
   - Identify proxy variables and correlation patterns
   - Calculate baseline fairness metrics

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential harm from biased decisions
   - Assess legal and reputational risks
   - Determine intervention urgency and resource allocation

### 1.2 Intervention Planning

**Decision Framework**:

```
Is there evidence of bias? 
├─ No → Document assessment, implement monitoring
└─ Yes → Proceed to causal analysis
    ├─ High-stakes domain (finance, healthcare, criminal justice)
    │   └─ Require comprehensive intervention across all levels
    └─ Lower-stakes domain
        └─ Focus on most cost-effective interventions
```

## Phase 2: Causal Analysis

### 2.1 Causal Model Construction

**Objective**: Understand how bias flows through your system to target interventions effectively.

**Key Activities**:
1. **Variable Identification**
   - Protected attributes (race, gender, age, etc.)
   - Mediators (influenced by protected attributes)
   - Proxies (correlated but not causally related)
   - Outcomes and legitimate predictors

2. **Causal Graph Development**
   - Use domain knowledge to map relationships
   - Distinguish direct, indirect, and proxy discrimination
   - Validate with conditional independence tests
   - Document assumptions and uncertainties

3. **Counterfactual Analysis**
   - Formulate "what if" queries
   - Assess individual-level fairness
   - Identify problematic causal pathways

### 2.2 Bias Mechanism Classification

Use this classification to guide intervention selection:

| Bias Type | Description | Primary Intervention |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Discrimination** | Protected attribute directly influences outcome | Remove attribute, add constraints |
| **Proxy Discrimination** | Correlated features leak protected info | Feature transformation, adversarial debiasing |
| **Indirect Discrimination** | Protected attribute affects legitimate mediators | Multi-objective optimization, careful mediator handling |
| **Historical Bias** | Past discrimination embedded in training data | Reweighting, synthetic data generation |
| **Selection Bias** | Non-representative training samples | Resampling, domain adaptation |

## Phase 3: Intervention Selection and Implementation

### 3.1 Intervention Decision Tree

```
Bias Mechanism Identified?
├─ Representation Disparity
│   ├─ Model supports weights? → Instance Weighting
│   └─ Model doesn't support weights? → Resampling/Synthetic Data
├─ Proxy Discrimination
│   ├─ Interpretability needed? → Disparate Impact Removal
│   └─ Complex relationships? → Fair Representations/Adversarial Debiasing
├─ Label Bias
│   └─ Historical discrimination in labels? → Prejudice Removal
└─ Multiple Mechanisms
    └─ Combine multiple interventions with validation
```

### 3.2 Implementation Sequence

**Recommended Order**:
1. **Pre-Processing** (if significant data issues identified)
2. **In-Processing** (for systematic bias in model training)
3. **Post-Processing** (for final adjustments and calibration)

**Integration Guidelines**:
- Document all intervention parameters and rationale
- Use consistent fairness metrics across interventions
- Validate each intervention before proceeding to the next
- Consider interaction effects between interventions

## Phase 4: Validation and Deployment

### 4.1 Validation Framework

**Multi-Dimensional Assessment**:

1. **Fairness Metrics**
   - Demographic parity: P(Ŷ=1|A=0) = P(Ŷ=1|A=1)
   - Equal opportunity: P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=0) = P(Ŷ=1|Y=1,A=1)
   - Equalized odds: Equal TPR and FPR across groups
   - Intersectional metrics for subgroups

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Overall accuracy, precision, recall
   - Group-specific performance measures
   - Calibration across protected groups
   - Business metrics (approval rates, revenue impact)

3. **Robustness Testing**
   - Performance on held-out test sets
   - Stability across different data distributions
   - Sensitivity to hyperparameter changes
   - Performance under distribution shift

### 4.2 Documentation Requirements

**Intervention Report Template**:
- **Problem Description**: Bias identified and evidence
- **Causal Analysis**: Mechanisms and pathways
- **Interventions Applied**: Techniques, parameters, rationale
- **Results**: Before/after metrics, trade-offs
- **Limitations**: Assumptions, uncertainties, residual risks
- **Monitoring Plan**: Ongoing assessment strategy

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

### 5.1 Continuous Monitoring

**Key Indicators**:
- Fairness metric drift over time
- Changes in group representation
- Performance degradation signals
- User feedback and complaints

**Monitoring Infrastructure**:
- Automated fairness metric calculation
- Alert systems for significant changes
- Regular manual audits (quarterly/annually)
- Stakeholder feedback loops

### 5.2 Adaptation Guidelines

**When to Reassess**:
- Significant changes in user population
- New protected attributes identified
- Regulatory requirement changes
- Model performance degradation
- Incident reports or bias complaints

## Key Decision Points and Considerations

### Resource Requirements

| Component | Time Investment | Expertise Required | Tools Needed |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Causal Analysis** | 2-4 weeks | Domain experts, data scientists | Causal modeling libraries |
| **Pre-Processing** | 1-2 weeks | Data engineers, statisticians | Data transformation tools |
| **In-Processing** | 2-3 weeks | ML engineers | Training frameworks |
| **Post-Processing** | 1 week | ML engineers | Threshold optimization tools |

### Risk Mitigation

**Common Risks and Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Fairness-Performance Trade-offs**
   - Risk: Significant accuracy loss
   - Mitigation: Progressive intervention, multi-objective optimization

2. **Intersectional Bias**
   - Risk: Fixing one bias while creating another
   - Mitigation: Explicit intersectional analysis and constraints

3. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Risk: Interventions don't meet legal requirements
   - Mitigation: Legal review, documentation, audit trails

4. **Implementation Complexity**
   - Risk: Teams struggle with technical implementation
   - Mitigation: Clear templates, training, expert consultation

### Integration with Existing Processes

**Development Workflow Integration**:
- Include fairness assessment in design reviews
- Add fairness metrics to CI/CD pipelines
- Incorporate bias testing in QA processes
- Document fairness considerations in model cards

**Organizational Considerations**:
- Train engineering teams on fairness concepts
- Establish fairness review boards for high-risk applications
- Create escalation paths for complex cases
- Align fairness goals with business objectives
